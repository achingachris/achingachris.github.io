i put a pause on writing technical articles. 

mainly because the platforms i love have become a hustle to use and they don't make it easier for people not registered on those platforms to read content.

i'm trying out some static site generators, would love to have content publicly accessible without any unnecessary stuff

## a bold move?

not really, but yeah! imagine having to settup a whole static site generator, while i could easily create an account on medium, or hashnode or dev.to, right?

## what next?

of course, migrating all articles from all these platforms and having them here.
