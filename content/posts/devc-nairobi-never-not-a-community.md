>I would like to take this time and write my appreciation to the diverse community that has made it all possible for me and all other members.

## My Community

Being part of a community is a gateway to your career success. Developer communities play a larger part in fulfilling this.

**Facebook Developer Circles**: Nairobi has been really helpful to my career and a source of motivation to keep building a stronger foundation, and ooh yeah write clean code. The weekly posts by the admins and moderators, the campus communities, and the free quality courses are just but a few blessings from the community.

## The DevC Programs

Every day of the week, I wake to amazing posts by the group that really fuel my day, take a look at them:

### Medium Mondays
Every Monday, we get to read good and fun technical articles written by our very own members. They are inspiring and easy to understand.

### Happy Hour Wednesdays
Previously during the Happy Hour Wednesdays, we’ve had Big O Notations challenges and examples to understand the algorithms and more.

### Cafe Thursdays
Newly introduced and it’s all about Mentorship! This is surely a treasure to keep hunting for.

### Fireside Fridays
Every Friday we get inspirations by reading interviews from experienced Developers in the field, how the came to achieve their goals and their day-to-day life. If this won’t make you work smarter to achieve your dreams and goals …

### DevC Nairobi at Campus

Well, this goes without saying, it has offered a platform to practice leadership of communities and more ways to get engaged and network in the DevC Community. It’s all great.

## Conclusion
To Conclude, I’d like to appreciate our leads, Carol, Eddie, Wambui, Jillo, and the whole squad. We all making coding simple, easy, and fun.
